Not started:
- Create architecture diagram with draw.io(?) in `architecture-diagram.png`

If have time:
- Static analysis in `slither_report.md`
- Manual pentesting in `manual_review.md` @Kraiois121

*For the grand oral:*
- on-chain logging with events
- off chain tamperproof logging (transparency log)
- automatic determination of condition fulfilment
(block time - not enuf transactions/conditions, NFT)
- run fuzzing with the operation itself completely randomised (run for more than 100 times)
- be clear in explaining the rules (protocols), emphasise on characteristics of protocol

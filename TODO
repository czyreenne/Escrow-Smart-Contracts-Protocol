Not started:
- Create architecture diagram with draw.io(?) in `architecture-diagram.png`

*For the grand oral:*
- on-chain logging with events [DONE]
- adjust manual tests to cover external condition [NOT STARTED]
- run fuzzing with the operation itself completely randomised (run for more than 100 times) [NOT STARTED]

Minor issues (doesn't affect functionality / functions are not used):
- Suppress/address mismatched ABI warnings (because there are events from 2 different contracts)
- Some interact.py functions don't have error messages
- get_condition_details and get_condition_status don't work correctly (some Opcode issue maybe due to flag/enum)

Future work:
- Implement NFT transfer ConditionType
- Implement Token Transfer (ERC-777) ConditionType

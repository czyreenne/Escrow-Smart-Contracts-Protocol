Not started:
- Create architecture diagram with draw.io(?) in `architecture-diagram.png`
- Update interact.py

If have time:
- Static analysis in `slither_report.md`
- Manual pentesting in `manual_review.md` @Kraiois121

*For the grand oral:*
- on-chain logging with events [DONE]
- automatic determination of condition fulfilment (e.g. block time - not enuf transactions/conditions, NFT) [IN PROGRESS]
- run fuzzing with the operation itself completely randomised (run for more than 100 times) [NOT STARTED]
- update README

MINOR ISSUES:
- Suppress/address mismatched ABI warnings (doesn't affect functionality, just that there are events from 2 different contracts)
- Some interact.py functions don't have error messages
- get_condition_details and get_condition_status don't work correctly (some Opcode issue maybe due to flag/enum, not required for testing)

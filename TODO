*For the grand oral:*
- on-chain logging with events [DONE]
- adjust manual tests to cover external condition [NOT STARTED]
- run fuzzing with the operation itself completely randomised (run for more than 100 times) [NOT STARTED]

Minor issues (doesn't affect functionality / functions are not used):
- Suppress/address mismatched ABI warnings (because there are events from 2 different contracts) [DONE]
- Some interact.py functions don't have error messages. Add pre-simulation to show revert reasons. [DONE - Added pre-sim to save gas on failed transactions irl.]
- get_condition_details and get_condition_status don't work correctly (some Opcode issue maybe due to flag/enum) [DEPRIORITISED]

Future work:
- Implement NFT transfer ConditionType
- Implement Token Transfer (ERC-777) ConditionType
- Keeper bot: Add historical event processing (currently only monitors "latest" block)
- Keeper bot: Add persistence to track processed conditions across restarts
- Design: Allow seller to create conditions instead of deployer (requires 2-step deployer)

- Define what is unresolved cases and when auto-refund should occur. *ISSUE*: Since contract immutable and in state 2, refund will not work even after timeout for security reasons. To resolve issue between balancing immutability and ability to auto-refund where needed. `Escrow.vy` `interact.py`
- Check who exactly is the buyer / seller in `Escrow.py`
- Research on whether Refund means take out temp block or add new block to reverse previous block

- Add more scenarios for `interact.py`
- Manual test for mutation/edge-case checks in `test_escrow.py`
- Fuzzing in `fuzz_test.py`
- Create architecture diagram with draw.io(?) in `architecture-diagram.png`
- Create slides + rehearse (max: 15 min)

If have time:
- Static analysis in `slither_report.md`
- Manual pentesting in `manual_review.md` @Kraiois121

Should we?:
- Add testing steps for using MetaMask and Testnet in `README.md`

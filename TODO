In progress: 
- only number of conditions are taken in. do we want to take in specific types of conditions? but then how do we systemically check for whether these conditions are fulfilled? accounting for different ways of fulfilling conditions based on factual scenario/nature of high factual dependency for determination of fulfilment of contract in law.
- right now, contract conditions that are fulfilled is also specified as a number. this number e.g. 2, takes the first 2 out of the 3 conditions to be fulfilled, and the last to be UNfulfilled.
- not sure if timeout really works. 

- To add validity check for integrity: Check who exactly is the buyer / seller in `Escrow.py`. Right now buyer private key and seller private key are inputted as OS variables. Since buyer is also deployer, getting buyer to deploy and run contract with buyer private key on OS would not be a problem but not sure how the logistics of inputting seller private key as an OS var would work?
- Research on whether Refund means take out temp block or add new block to reverse previous block

Not started:
- Manual test for mutation/edge-case checks in `test_escrow.py`
- Fuzzing in `fuzz_test.py`
- Create architecture diagram with draw.io(?) in `architecture-diagram.png`
- Create slides + rehearse (max: 15 min)

If have time:
- Static analysis in `slither_report.md`
- Manual pentesting in `manual_review.md` @Kraiois121

Should we?:
- Add testing steps for using MetaMask and Testnet in `README.md`

## As a Buyer:
- I want to securely deposit funds for a transaction so they are only released after a contract is fulfilled.
- I want my funds to be auto-refunded if the seller does not fulfill within the agreed time.

## As a Seller:
- I want assurance that, once I fulfill the contract obligations, I can claim the funds.

## As an Auditor:
- I want transparent event logs for all actions (deposit, release, refund, errors).

## As a Developer:
- I want to extend this protocol easily for future legal or technical requirements.
